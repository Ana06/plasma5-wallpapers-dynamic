# TODO

* Properly handle north pole case: currently it's implicitly handled,
  the wallpaper plugin should either display only day/night picture or
  display an error message
* Smooth transition to a new dynamic wallpaper (when user tests different
  wallpapers in the configuration dialog)
* Try to avoid using Image.cache

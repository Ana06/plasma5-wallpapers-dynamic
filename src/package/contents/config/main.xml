      The fill mode specifies what happens when an image has a different size than
      the screen.

      0 - the image is scaled to fit the screen
      1 - the image is scaled to fit the screen without cropping
      2 - the image is scaled to fit the screen, with cropping if necessary
      3 - the image is tiled horizontally and vertically
      4 - the image is stretched horizontally and tiled vertically
      5 - the image is stretched vertically and tiled horizontally
      6 - the image is not transformed
